# vecr-compress

English | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

**Auditable, deterministic context compression for LLMs.** Structured data — order IDs, URLs, dates, citations, code — survives compression by an explicit regex whitelist you can inspect, extend, and audit. Every pin and every drop is logged: you get a `retained_matches` list and a `dropped_segments` list on every call.

## Why this exists

A 2026 Factory.ai production study found that "artifact tracking" (IDs, file paths, error codes) is the worst-compressed category across every compressor tested — scoring just 2.19–2.45 out of 5.0, worse even than OpenAI's native compaction (3.43/5.0). No shipped library offers a deterministic retention primitive: they all rely on LLM judgment or learned scoring that can silently drop a customer ID, a transaction amount, or a compliance citation. vecr-compress solves exactly that gap. It does not claim the highest compression ratio — that is Compresr's lane. It offers an auditable, extensible whitelist-based compressor you can reason about end-to-end.

## 30-second example

```python
from vecr_compress import compress

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a refund analyst."},
    {"role": "user", "content":
        "Hi there! Thanks so much for reaching out today. "
        "Hope you are having a wonderful morning. "
        "We really appreciate you writing in. "
        "Happy to take a look at this for you. "
        "Totally understand how important this is. "
        "Sure thing, let me pull up the record. "
        "Absolutely, this is our top priority. "
        "The refund request references order ORD-99172 placed on 2026-03-15. "
        "The customer email is buyer@example.com. "
        "The total charge was $1,499.00 on card ending 4242. "
        "Thanks again for your patience and have a great day!"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the order ID and refund amount?"},
]

result = compress(messages, budget_tokens=80, protect_tail=1)

for m in result.messages:
    print(m["role"], "->", m["content"])

print(f"\n{result.original_tokens} -> {result.compressed_tokens} tokens "
      f"({result.ratio:.2%}); pinned {len(result.retained_matches)} facts, "
      f"dropped {len(result.dropped_segments)} segments")
```

Every structured fact in the input — `ORD-99172`, `2026-03-15`, `buyer@example.com`, `$1,499.00` — survives, because each is pinned by the retention whitelist before the knapsack budget packing runs. Filler sentences like "We really appreciate you writing in" and "Sure thing, let me pull up the record" are dropped. On this fixture: 131 → 78 tokens (~60%), 3 facts pinned, 6 filler segments dropped.

> Why `protect_tail=1`? By default the last two messages are pinned untouched (so the user turn with the actual question is always preserved). Here the penultimate turn is the body we *want* to compress, so we drop the tail pin to 1. See the [API docs](RETENTION.md) for `protect_tail` / `protect_system` semantics.

## The retention contract

vecr-compress ships 13 built-in rules. Any segment containing a match is **pinned** — kept regardless of token budget. If total pinned content exceeds the budget, the compressor returns all pinned segments and logs a warning rather than silently dropping facts.

| Pattern | Example match | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| `uuid` | `3f6e4b1a-23cd-4e5f-9012-abcdef012345` | Trace IDs, session IDs, correlation keys |
| `date` | `2026-03-15`, `2026-03-15T09:30:00` | Deadlines, timestamps, audit trails |
| `code-id` | `ORD-99172`, `INV_2024_A`, `CUST#42` | Order, invoice, customer identifiers |
| `email` | `buyer@example.com` | Contact records, PII audit |
| `url` | `https://api.example.com/v2/orders` | Endpoints, evidence links, sources |
| `path` | `/var/log/app/error.log`, `C:/data/report.csv` | File references, error locations |
| `code-span` | `` `raise ValueError(msg)` `` | Inline code in prose |
| `fn-call` | `process_refund(order_id, amount)`, `obj.method(a, b)` (code-like identifiers only) | Function references in code review |
| `citation` | `[12]`, `[Smith 2023]` | Academic and legal citations |
| `json-kv` | `"status": "pending_review"` | Structured payload fields |
| `hash` | `9f3ab2c4` (8+ hex chars, 2+ digits) | Git SHAs, content digests |
| `number` | `$1,499.00`, `12.4%`, `v3.2.1` | Amounts, rates, version strings |
| `integer` | `9172`, `99172`, `2026` (4+ digits) | IDs, reference numbers, years |

Extend the contract with your own rules:

```python
import re
from vecr_compress import compress, RetentionRule, DEFAULT_RULES

custom_rules = DEFAULT_RULES.with_extra([
    RetentionRule(name="invoice", pattern=re.compile(r"INV-\d{6}")),
])
result = compress(messages, budget_tokens=2000, retention_rules=custom_rules)
```

Details on testing and extending rules: see [RETENTION.md](RETENTION.md).

## Benchmark (reproducible)

Needle-in-haystack survival: 11 needles × 3 positions × 6 ratios × 3 configs = 594 trials (`bench/needle.py`).

**Structured needles (7) — baseline vs. L2 retention**

| ratio | baseline | + L2 retention |
|---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1.00 | 100% | 100% |
| 0.50 | 100% | 100% |
| 0.30 | 100% | 100% |
| 0.15 | 100% | 100% |
| 0.08 | 100% | 100% |
| 0.04 | 100% | 100% |

The baseline heuristic scorer keeps all structured tokens in this synthetic fixture. L2 turns that measurement into a **deterministic contract** — the same 100% holds across any workload, scorer, or distribution, not just this fixture. If `ORD-\d+` appears in the input, it will appear in the output.

**Stealth needles (4, plain prose) — where the tradeoff shows**

| ratio | baseline | + L2 retention |
|---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1.00 | 100% | 100% |
| 0.50 | 100% | 100% |
| 0.30 | 83% | 83% |
| 0.15 | 75% | 67% |
| 0.08 | 75% | 0% |
| 0.04 | 75% | 0% |

L2's cost: must-keep structured content pins the budget, leaving little room for plain-prose stealth needles at aggressive ratios (target 0.15 → actual 0.16 because the whitelist overrides the budget). On natural-language QA (HotpotQA probe, N=100) a blended question-aware scorer adds **+9.9pp supporting-fact survival** at ratio 0.5 over L2 alone — opt in with `compress(..., use_question_relevance=True)` (v0.1.3+). Off by default so the deterministic contract stays loud; worth turning on when your context is long prose and you have a real question. See [docs/BENCHMARK.md](docs/BENCHMARK.md) for details.

Note: actual compression ratio may exceed the target when must-keep content is large — this is intentional and honest behaviour, not a bug.

To reproduce:

```bash
pip install -e .
python -m bench.needle
```

## Install

```bash
pip install vecr-compress                  # core only (requires tiktoken)
pip install vecr-compress[langchain]       # + LangChain adapter
pip install vecr-compress[llamaindex]      # + LlamaIndex adapter
```

Requires Python 3.10+.

## LangChain / LlamaIndex

Framework adapters are opt-in via extras (`[langchain]`, `[llamaindex]`). Core compression has no framework dependency.

**LangChain** — compress a chat history before passing it to any chat model:

```python
from langchain.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from vecr_compress.adapters.langchain import VecrContextCompressor

compressor = VecrContextCompressor(budget_tokens=2000)
compressed = compressor.compress_messages([
    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
    HumanMessage(content="Long conversation history..."),
    HumanMessage(content="The actual question."),
])

# NL-QA workload with a real user question? Opt in to question-aware blending:
#   VecrContextCompressor(budget_tokens=2000, use_question_relevance=True)
```

**LlamaIndex** — postprocess retrieved nodes before synthesis:

```python
from llama_index.core.schema import NodeWithScore, TextNode
from vecr_compress.adapters.llamaindex import VecrNodePostprocessor

processor = VecrNodePostprocessor(budget_tokens=1500)
kept = processor.postprocess_nodes(nodes, query_str="the user's question")
```

## How it works (30-second tour)

Two layers applied in order:

1. **Retention whitelist** — segments matching any built-in rule are pinned and bypass the budget knapsack entirely.
2. **Heuristic packing** — remaining segments are scored by entropy and structural signal (digits, braces, capitalization); filler lines like `Hi!`, `Thanks!`, `As an AI…` score 0.0 and are dropped before any budget math; the rest are packed greedily into the token budget.

Question-aware blending is opt-in via `compress(..., use_question_relevance=True)` (v0.1.3+); it layers a Jaccard overlap score (0.4 weight) on top of the heuristic (0.6 weight). Advanced callers can also pass a custom `ScorerFn` — `blended_score`, `heuristic_score`, and `question_relevance` are all exported from `vecr_compress`. See [RETENTION.md](RETENTION.md) for details.

## vs. alternatives

| | Approach | Open source | Retention contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Compresr (YC W26)** | LLM summarization, hosted model | No | None — JSON atomic treatment is planned |
| **LLMLingua-2** | Probabilistic token classifier | Yes | None |
| **LangChain DeepAgents compact** | Autonomous agent-triggered | Yes (LangChain) | None |
| **Provider-native compaction** (OpenAI/Google) | Opaque, single-provider | No | None |
| **vecr-compress** | Regex whitelist + heuristic knapsack | Yes | **Deterministic, auditable** |

Choose Compresr for maximum compression ratio. Choose LLMLingua-2 for pure-Python research. Choose vecr-compress when you want an auditable, extensible whitelist-based compressor you can reason about end-to-end, and you can live with v0.1 limits (Python-only, sentence-level granularity, no streaming).

## What this does NOT do

- **No streaming.** `compress()` is synchronous and one-shot.
- **No tool-call rewriting.** `tool_use` / `tool_result` blocks pass through verbatim — safe, zero gain.
- **Sentence-level granularity only.** No token-level pruning or learned rewrites.
- **English-tuned.** Stopword list and regex patterns are English-first. Multilingual quality is untested.
- **No embedding scorer.** Jaccard overlap is lexical. Semantic relevance scoring lives in the reference gateway.
